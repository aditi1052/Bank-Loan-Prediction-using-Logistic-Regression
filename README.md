# Bank-Loan-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
1) Project Overview:

*This project applies logistic regression to predict whether a bank loan application will be approved or not.
*The dataset includes applicant details such as Cibil Score, Dependents, Previous Loan History, and more. 
*The goal is to build a predictive model that helps financial institutions automate loan approval decisions efficiently.

2) Dataset & Features:
After feature selection, the following variables were used for training:

Cibil Score – Creditworthiness of the applicant
Dependents – Number of dependents in the family
Gender – Applicant’s gender
Married – Marital status
Self_Employed – Employment type
Previous Loan Taken – Whether the applicant has taken a loan before

3)Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing – Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and selected important features.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identified patterns and relationships between features.

3️⃣ Model Training – Applied logistic regression and evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

4️⃣ Model Optimization – Addressed class imbalance and explored improvements like feature engineering and alternative models.
